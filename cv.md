Hello! My name is Vadim. I am taking an additional course to become a junior front-end developer. I graduated from the Belarussian-Russian University in Mogilev, Belarus and started a career of mechanical engineer in 2011. However, an IT career seems more preferable to me nowadays. My ambition is to become a skillful front-end software engineer, gaining new knowledge is a great pleasure for me.
